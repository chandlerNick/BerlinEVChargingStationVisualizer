Analyze both geovisualizations: Where do you see demand for additional electric charging stations?

Answer:
Assuming we define demand as the ratio of population over number of charging stations with a high value indicating a high demand for charging stations, we can make the following quick deductions from the visualization:
High demand PLZ were identified by looking at PLZ with a light yellow on the charging station map and medium lightness orange or darker on the population map, indicating few charging stations (<5) and medium to high population (>15000) respectively.
Based on this creterion, PLZ with a high demand for EV stations are:
    - 12559
    - 13589
    - 13439
    - 13407
    - 13059
    - 13627
    - 13351
    - 13349
    - 13359
    - 13189
    - 10318
    - 14193
    - 12277
    - 12307
